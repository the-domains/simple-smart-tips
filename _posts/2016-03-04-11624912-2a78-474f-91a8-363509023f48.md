For the past three years, I have been trying to figure out a
storage solution for the countless cables that seem to fill up spaces
throughout our apartment.We have collected
various phone cables, audio and video cables (Who really uses RCA cables
anymore?), VGA, USB, Micro-USB, power cables and cables for devices we no
longer own.I have tried several ways of
corralling them from coiling, using cable ties, using drawers, baskets and
bins, but none seemed to work well. 

Here are some of the issues I had during the three-year trial
and error period.

**Coiling:** I found
that it was hard to uniformly coil the cables so they all fit properly into
each respective storage container.Some
cables are thick and hard to coil and others are too short to coil.Coiling wasn't a favorite.

**Cable Ties: **Cable
ties are always very useful, especially if they are reusable (waste not, want
not!).However, if you're using
re-usable ties, you can't cut them to length, which means that in your
container, you have all of the un-cut ends sticking up and taking up
space!And if you're not using re-usable
ties, you would need to cut the tie each time you wanted to find a specific
cable, wasting a tie if it's the wrong one.I don't like to waste, so cable ties are out.

**Drawers:** Though I
love a great cabinet with lots of drawer space, I found most drawers to be
either too deep or not sturdy enough to house our collection of cables.I'll save our drawers for clothes.

**Baskets: **I love
baskets and bins, but not when trying to store cables.I found the ends of the cables get stuck in
the weave or in any holes on the sides of the bins.They didn't tame the cables.

One of the secrets to storage is answering these two
questions: how much stuff do you have to store?And how much space do you have to store this stuff? There is nothing more frustrating than
starting a storage project and finding out that cute container you found just
won't fit, or isn't big enough.

The first step is to collect all of the items for this
storage project, search your home and put everything in one location.I spent about half an hour corralling all of
our cables.I went room to room with a
basket and checked every drawer, cupboard, shelf, basket and bag.

The next step is to sort out the collection, identify and divide
into categories such as; "Keep", "Sell", "Donate" and "Recycle/Toss". The items in the "Keep" pile will be
stored.In this project, I further
sorted "Keep" into piles depending on the type of cable, such as Audio/Video, Apple
cables, Computer and network.

The next step is finding that perfect container.Take measurements of the space and make sure
to bring a tape measure with you to the store so you can measure before you
buy.I knew that I wanted a narrow clear
container and found a large Iris Portable Scrapbook Case.I was also able to find a set of Plastic Grid
Drawer Dividers to break up the space into smaller sections.I also saved up our paper towel, toilet paper
and wrapping paper rolls to use as slots inside the case.The case opens with a large hinged lid and
all the cables can be accessed at once.The case also has a handle, which gives you something to hang onto if
you're putting it on an upper shelf.

Once the cables were all sorted and deciphered, using small
elastics, I coiled the cables so that they would slide into the rolls and stand
upright in the case.I made sure that
the termination ends of the cables are visible so you can see which cable is
which.I filled each divided section
with similar cables until the container was filled.

You could take this one step further and label your
cardboard tubes with type and length, but we didn't have enough variety to
justify this step.

In the end, I was able to reduce our cable clutter from an
overflowing, scattered collection to only one large, organized container.The extra cables we accumulated over the
years have all been sold, donated or recycled.

If anyone has any cable storage tips, I would love to hear
them! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bc3d97a7-ab7b-49c8-9a78-453fab121274.jpg)
